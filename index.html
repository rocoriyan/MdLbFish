                    <p>You may not know this but the size of a goldfish is almost entirely dependent on its environment. This is because it is a type of carp, many of which grow based on their access to food and space. This means that if you release a goldfish into the wild such as in a pond, the goldfish will quickly eat everything available to it and destroy the ecosystem.</p>

                <p>While large goldfish look unusual and interesting, their growth comes at the cost of the environment they were released into. Ecosystems such as small ponds are only sustainable when all elements return the same value they take from the it. Goldfish, however, outcompete native fish, eating all of their food and causing their numbers to thin. This impacts life all across the foodchain in the pond and can lead to the destruction of the ecosystem as a whole.</p>
